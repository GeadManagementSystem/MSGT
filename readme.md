## Statement of the problem

One of the issues of the existing system is the use of paper-based documentation for transactions and stock
information. Paper-based systems will limit the collaboration between the staff. Understanding the changes
that other staff members made requires exhaustively going through papers. This makes it very hard for the staff
members to communicate effectively.
Second problem of using this system is that it leads to a lot of damage. Paper-based documents can be damaged
from the wear and tear of regular handling, which makes it a very unreliable mechanism for handling important
issues.

The Existing system also involves vast amount of mathematical works that are mostly done manually. This
will in turn introduce human errors to the system. This has many consequences to the business. It would be
very hard and time consuming to check for errors. Even if errors were found, correcting them is also a hurdle.
In some cases, the errors may not even be discovered, which means the company will be forced to pay a higher
or lower amount of taxes than it is required. Which is illegal in both ways and affect the business and the
country as well.

The other issue is in knowing the exact financial state of the business which is a very time-consuming activity.
The main aim of business owner is to make a profit and most businesses use their previous sales and marketing
plans to make future decisions. But the current system does not enable the company to know if their past
decisions are good or not, in an acceptable amount of time. So, they will resort to pure instincts in making this
important decision, rather than logically assessing them.

## Objective of Project

The main objective of the project is to develop a user-friendly computerized system which will enable
the company(G General Trading) to run its business with minimal workload.

## Proposed System

In the new system, when new goods come to the store the stock manager will add them to the system through
the GUI (graphical user interface) and they will be transferred to a storage facility. When a customer buys an
item from the store, the salesperson will use the system to add a transaction and notify the stock manager to
deliver the items from storage. Then the salesperson will confirm the transaction and will also print the receipt
for the customer.

The manager will use the new system to oversee all activities happening at the store. He/she will log in to the
system and will be able to view and update staff information and also get comprehensive sales data report. At
the end of each week the manager will be able to view or print the system generated report.
